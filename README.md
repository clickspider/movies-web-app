# Movies Web App

![Design preview for the Entertainment web app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


#### Global pre-requisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16.x or higher, preferably latest LTS)


#### Getting started
Navigate to the repository's root directory and run the following commands:
```
yarn
yarn start
```
- The application is now running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


## In this app:

The users are be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
- **Bonus**: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow

### Expected Behaviour

- General
  - The navigation menu should be fixed to the left for larger screens. Use the "Desktop - Home" page in the design as a visual reference.
- Home
  - The trending section should scroll sideways to reveal other trending shows
  - Any search input should search through all shows (i.e. all movies and TV series)
- Movies
  - This page should only display shows with the "Movie" category
  - Any search input should search through all movies
- TV Series
  - This page should only display shows with the "TV Series" category
  - Any search input should search through all TV series
- Bookmarked Shows
  - This page should display all bookmarked shows from both categories
  - Any search input should search through all bookmarked shows
